          the IELTS exam in 2020 with 6.5 band scores and now i want to go to abroad for further study.As my country is
          known for it's linguistic diversity, there are several dialects spoken in India but the most common language
          of India is Hindi. Moreover, I can speak three vernaculars such as Hindi, Punjabi and English. It makes
